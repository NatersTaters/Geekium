# Geekium
This is the Capstone project created by Nathaniel Saunders, Andrew Truong and Leunard Gervalla for their CPA course at Conestoga College.

In order to run this project, you are required to run the create_geekium_db.sql script and create an instance of the required database on your local SQL server,
then you must open the project solution and update the connection string in both the appsettings.json file and the GeekiumContext.cs file.

Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio are required to open and run both the project solution and the required database
